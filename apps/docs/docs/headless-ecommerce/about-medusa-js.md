# About Medusa.js
Medusa.js is the core of Universal Medusa. A suite of commerce modules that are the foundation of the universal architecture.

This enables you to start an ecommerce website and mobile app with rich, reliable, and performant commerce logic without reinventing core commerce logic and building or extending once and have it replicated on each platform without any extra development per platform.

You get all the modules connected to the frontend and backend to get right out of the box a running ecommerce application.
